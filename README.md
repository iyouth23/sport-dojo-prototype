This is a working prototype of the website for Sport Dojo, a soccer-focused startup based in St. Louis, Missouri. Sport Dojo, along with its corresponding app (currently in development), aims to use the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning to advise coaches about all aspects of soccer. 

This website has multiple features:

* A Home page
* An About page
* A Resources page
* A Contact page

Within the Resources page, there are two widgets:

* The Event Tagger. This widget allows one to record key events of a soccer game on a virtual soccer field after uploading a video from YouTube or one's Desktop. Relevant attributes (players, locations, types of plays, etc.) can then be exported for further analysis.

* The Event Labeler. This widgets allows one to play through a soccer match after uploading a video from YouTube or one's Desktop. The video can then be replayed with user annotations.

Note that because this website has no login or registration implemented, the corresponding buttons will simply redirect the user to a form to obtain more information about the startup.
